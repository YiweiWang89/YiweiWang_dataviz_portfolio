# Critique by Redesign
#### Brief Introduction
In this assignment I selected a public visualization about U.S. birthdays. Using the 1994–2014 U.S. daily births dataset, my goals were to 

(1) evaluate the original chart on usefulness, completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement;

(2) identify concrete pain points; 

(3) produce a clearer redesign that communicates the main patterns without extra explanation.

## The visualization
#### Original graphic：[How Common Is Your Birthday? — DailyViz (2016)](http://thedailyviz.com/2016/09/17/how-common-is-your-birthday-dailyviz/)

**Data source:**  
[MakeoverMonday Week 26 dataset](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w26) — compiled from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (1994–2003) and the U.S. Social Security Administration (2004–2014).

**Why I selected this visualization ？**
I chose this piece because it is instantly relatable—everyone has a birthday—yet it raises substantive design questions worth critiquing. The calendar heatmap format is engaging and encourages exploration across months and days, but it also creates challenges around scale interpretation, visual density, and how readers compare days within and across months. The topic combines broad public interest with credible, well-scoped data (1994–2014 U.S. daily births), making it ideal for a critique-by-redesign exercise: the story is simple enough to evaluate quickly, but the presentation choices (color scale, labeling, ranking, and layout) leave room for improvement and discussion about clarity and readability.
 
## Critique
**Perceptibility — 6/10**

Calendar grid is familiar, but the color scale/legend isn’t self-evident.

Small differences appear more pronounced than they are; no clear zero/reference to anchor “typical”.

**Usefulness — 7/10**

Instantly answers the casual question: “How common is my birthday?”

Beyond the lookup, it’s hard to make reliable comparisons across months/days without guidance.

**Completeness — 5/10**

Long time span is a strength, but the single view omits key facets (weekday effects, variability, year-to-year change).

Little context on why certain dates are high/low.

**Truthfulness — 6/10**

Uses credible sources, but averaging across years can hide variation; viewers may infer precision the chart doesn’t support.

Color ramp may overstate minor differences.

**Intuitiveness — 7/10**

Month×day layout is immediately understood.

However, interpreting what the colors mean (and how much they mean) requires the legend and effort.

**Aesthetics — 8/10**

Clean, uniform grid; pleasing palette; shareable.

Visual density can feel heavy at full scale.

**Engagement — 7/10**

Strong personal hook (everyone checks their own date).

Engagement drops after the first lookup; few cues to explore further.

**Accessibility — 6/10**

Dot marks are clear, but reliance on hue alone may be tough for some viewers.

Small labels/legend can be hard to read on smaller screens.

**Overall observations**

What stood out to me about this visualization is that it’s eye-catching and easy to engage with at first, especially since people naturally want to check their own birthday. The heatmap design does a good job of showing broad seasonal trends like the September peak and the holiday dips, which makes the overall message fairly intuitive. However, many of the issues we discussed earlier also show up here: the usefulness feels limited because it mainly answers a novelty question without deeper insights, the completeness is lacking since it ignores weekday or holiday effects, and the legend makes perceptibility harder than it should be. Even though the data is accurate, the way it’s averaged hides variation across years, and the tooltip overloads readers with too much detail at once. Aesthetically it’s clean, but the dense wall of color is tiring, and in terms of engagement it doesn’t sustain interest beyond the initial curiosity. Overall, it works well as a quick visual hook but struggles to provide clarity and context that would make it truly informative.

**Focus for the redesign**

In my redesign, I want to focus on making the visualization more complete and easier to interpret by adding context that was missing in the original. I plan to normalize the data by year to avoid distortion from population changes, and highlight weekends and major holidays since they strongly affect birth counts. I also want to improve the legend and color scale so differences are clearer, and label the top and bottom dates directly instead of leaving them hidden in the colors. Beyond the heatmap, I’m also interested in experimenting with a bar chart or calendat that may gives more information or better visual. I’m excited to compare both designs and see whether a line view or a hybrid approach communicates the key story more clearly.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
