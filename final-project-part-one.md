# Outline
For my final project, I want to explore how art collections change over time and what that says about representation in the art world. I’m especially interested in who gets collected (for example, differences between male and female artists) and how those patterns have shifted in recent decades. Museums and collections play a big role in shaping cultural memory, so it’s worth asking whether they are becoming more inclusive or still reflecting older imbalances.

I also want to look at patterns across departments and mediums (painting, photography, design, etc.) and explore whether the time it takes for an artwork to be acquired after it was created has changed. My goal is to keep the analysis accessible—focusing on clear visuals that help people quickly see the patterns and understand the bigger story about representation and recognition in art.

One Sentence summary:
> Museums don’t just collect art, they shape whose voices and perspectives are remembered, and the data shows how representation and recognition have shifted over time.

# The data
I use two public datasets from the MoMA Collection, available through Maven Analytics. The first is the Artworks table, which includes details like artwork title, date made, medium, department, and date acquired. The second is the Artists table, which records attributes such as artist name, gender, nationality, and life dates. These two tables can be linked through the Constituent ID field.

I plan to use these datasets together to tell a story about representation in MoMA’s collection. The Artworks table provides the timeline of acquisitions and the context of which departments and mediums works belong to. The Artists table allows me to analyze who is represented, with a focus on gender and nationality. Together, they make it possible to track changes in gender balance across decades, compare departments, and calculate how long it took for different works to be acquired. This combination allows me to show not only the growth of MoMA’s collection but also the ways inclusion and recognition have shifted over time.

# Method and medium
I will use Tableau to create interactive charts and then embed them in Shorthand to build a scroll-based narrative. This combination allows me to present both the data analysis and the story flow in an engaging, interactive way.

I used AI mainly to get a bit of help with technical refinements, catching small grammar mistakes, and brainstorming extra sketch ideas.
