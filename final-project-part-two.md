# Wireframes / storyboards

# User research protocol
## Target audience 
My intended target audience includes people who interact with art and museums in different ways, since my project focuses on representation in museum collections. I want the story to resonate both with casual audiences and with people who think more critically about inclusion in art institutions.

To identify representative individuals to interview, I considered three perspectives: someone who regularly visits museums and can reflect on their experiences as a visitor, someone who has a background or interest in cultural studies or art history, and someone who does not usually think about art or museums but can give feedback on whether my story is accessible to a general audience.  

## Interview script
Visual Communication (whether the design and chart choices make the data easy to read)
Storytelling and Understanding (whether the narrative of inclusivity and representation comes through clearly)
Audience Engagement and Reflection (whether people connect with the topic and feel motivated to think about museum practices)

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Visual Communication: Design | Are the charts (colors, labels, and layout) easy to read? Did anything feel distracting or confusing? |
| Visual Communication: Chart Choice | Do the chart types (e.g., gender ratio comparisons, maps of artist origins) help you understand the point? Which felt most effective or least effective? |
| Storytelling and Understanding: Clarity | Is the main message of the story clear? |
| Storytelling and Understanding: Context | Was there enough explanation alongside the visuals, or did you feel like you needed more background information? |
| Audience Engagement and Reflection: Interest | While looking at the visuals, did you stay interested? Were there sections that felt less engaging? |

## Interview findings

| Questions | Interview 1: Peer Critique (classmate) | Interview 2: Sister (art enthusiast) | Interview 3: A 20s Frequent Museum Visitor |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Are the charts (colors, labels, and layout) easy to read? Did anything feel distracting or confusing?** | The colors were readable, but some of the charts looked overcrowded. The treemap, for example, had too many tiny boxes, which made it hard to follow. | The backgrounds created with different paintings made the project feel artistic and visually appealing. The charts themselves were clear, but the pie chart felt too simple compared to the others. May add more pie chart to show different takeaways. | The labels on the stacked bar chart felt distracting. A simpler layout with more focus on one theme would make the design stronger.  |
| **Do the chart types (e.g., gender ratio comparisons, maps of artist origins) help you understand the point? Which felt most effective or least effective?** | The gender ratio comparisons, like the pie chart and stacked bar, worked best. Mixing gender, geography, and medium together was distracting, and focusing on a single theme would make the message easier to get. | The treemap stood out the most because it clearly showed how women were underrepresented in many classifications. The map looked nice, but the gender-based visuals were more effective in delivering the message when audience see the hook. | The area chart showing the growth of the collection over time was the most effective. It told a story, but it would have been even more meaningful with annotations about events, such as changes in museum policies or social movements in the content. |
| **Is the main message of the story clear?** | The main message was visible, but trying to cover too many angles weakened the impact. Narrowing the focus to gender alone would make the narrative much stronger. | The message about gender imbalance was very clear. Each section used a different chart to reinforce the theme, which made the story easy to follow. | The story came through, but it leaned toward being academic. It would connect better with me if it explained why these patterns matter when people walk into a museum. |
| **Was there enough explanation alongside the visuals, or did you feel like you needed more background information?** | The data felt limited to MoMA, which made the story too narrow. Adding comparisons with other museums, like the Tate or the Louvre, would make the findings more convincing. | The visuals already carried the main point, but including quotes from women artists or curators could have made the story feel more personal. | A bit more historical context would help, such as when women started receiving greater recognition or examples of landmark exhibitions that shifted museum practices. |
| **While looking at the visuals, did you stay interested? Were there sections that felt less engaging?** | The visuals were engaging overall, but juggling multiple themes risked losing the audienceâ€™s attention. Try focusing on gender and look for more interesting data that can contribute to the topic.| The combination of data and painting backgrounds was creative and engaging. It encouraged me to keep scrolling. | Yes, I would see the museum differently after knowing this. |
