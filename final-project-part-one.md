# Outline
> As capture fisheries plateau, aquaculture fills the global seafood gap—especially in Asia—shifting the balance of supply and reframing sustainability questions for the next decade.

Global seafood demand has more than doubled over the last half-century, but wild (capture) fisheries stopped growing decades ago due to biological limits. In response, aquaculture (farmed fish) has expanded rapidly and is now a central pillar of the world’s seafood supply.

This project tells the story of how aquaculture rose from a niche practice to a dominant source of fish, where this growth happened (regional and country patterns), and why it matters (relieving pressure on overexploited wild stocks while introducing its own sustainability challenges). Using three complementary datasets, I’ll visualize the transition from capture to aquaculture, spotlight leading producers, and connect production trends to the share of fish stocks that are biologically sustainable vs. overexploited.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
I use three public datasets from Our World in Data (FAO-based). The first contains aquaculture production by entity and year; the second includes both aquaculture and capture fisheries so I can directly compare and identify the crossover where aquaculture surpasses capture; the third reports shares of fish stocks that are biologically sustainable vs overexploited, grounding the sustainability angle.

I plan to use these datasets together to tell a connected story. The aquaculture and capture production data will show the historical rise of farmed fish and highlight the turning point where aquaculture surpassed capture. Breaking the data down by country and region will allow me to identify leading producers and regional differences in reliance on aquaculture. The sustainability dataset adds important context, linking the stagnation of capture fisheries to overexploitation of wild stocks. Together, these sources allow me to illustrate not only the growth of aquaculture but also why it matters for the future of global food security.

# Method and medium
I will use Tableau to create interactive charts and then embed them in Shorthand to build a scroll-based narrative. This combination allows me to present both the data analysis and the story flow in an engaging, interactive way.
