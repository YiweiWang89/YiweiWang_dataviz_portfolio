# Critique by Redesign
#### Brief Introduction
In this assignment I selected a public visualization about U.S. birthdays. Using the 1994–2014 U.S. daily births dataset, my goals were to 
(1) evaluate the original chart on usefulness, completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement; 
(2) identify concrete pain points; 
(3) produce a clearer redesign that communicates the main patterns without extra explanation.

## The visualization
### Original graphic：How Common Is Your Birthday? — DailyViz (2016)
**Link:** http://thedailyviz.com/2016/09/17/how-common-is-your-birthday-dailyviz/

**Data source**：MakeoverMonday Week 26 dataset: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w26
(Compiled from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1994–2003, and the U.S. Social Security Administration, 2004–2014; also cited via FiveThirtyEight/DailyViz.)

**Why I selected this visualization ？**
I chose this piece because it is instantly relatable—everyone has a birthday—yet it raises substantive design questions worth critiquing. The calendar heatmap format is engaging and encourages exploration across months and days, but it also creates challenges around scale interpretation, visual density, and how readers compare days within and across months. The topic combines broad public interest with credible, well-scoped data (1994–2014 U.S. daily births), making it ideal for a critique-by-redesign exercise: the story is simple enough to evaluate quickly, but the presentation choices (color scale, labeling, ranking, and layout) leave room for improvement and discussion about clarity and readability.
 

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
