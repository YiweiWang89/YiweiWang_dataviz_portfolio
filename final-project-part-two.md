# Wireframes / storyboards

# User research protocol

## Target audience 
My intended target audience includes people who interact with art and museums in different ways, since my project focuses on representation in museum collections. I want the story to resonate both with casual audiences and with people who think more critically about inclusion in art institutions.

To identify representative individuals to interview, I considered three perspectives: someone who regularly visits museums and can reflect on their experiences as a visitor, someone who has a background or interest in cultural studies or art history, and someone who does not usually think about art or museums but can give feedback on whether my story is accessible to a general audience.  

## Interview script

Visual Communication (whether the design and chart choices make the data easy to read)

Storytelling and Understanding (whether the narrative of inclusivity and representation comes through clearly)

Audience Engagement and Reflection (whether people connect with the topic and feel motivated to think about museum practices)

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Visual Communication: Design | Are the charts (colors, labels, and layout) easy to read? Did anything feel distracting or confusing? |
| Visual Communication: Chart Choice | Do the chart types (e.g., gender ratio comparisons, maps of artist origins) help you understand the point? Which felt most effective or least effective? |
| Storytelling and Understanding: Clarity | Is the main message of the story clear? |
| Storytelling and Understanding: Context | Was there enough explanation alongside the visuals, or did you feel like you needed more background information? |
| Audience Engagement and Reflection: Interest | While looking at the visuals, did you stay interested? Were there sections that felt less engaging? |
