# Outline
Global seafood demand has more than doubled in the last fifty years, but the amount of fish we can catch from the wild has stayed about the same since the 1980s because of natural limits. To keep up with demand, aquaculture (farmed fish) has grown quickly and now plays a major role in the world’s seafood supply.

In this project, I want to show how aquaculture grew from something small into one of the main ways people get fish. I will highlight where this growth is happening (by region and country) and explain why it matters—not only because it helps reduce pressure on wild fish, but also because it brings new sustainability challenges.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

One Sentence summary:
> Since wild fishing has stopped growing, aquaculture is filling the gap—mostly in Asia—and this shift is changing the seafood market and how we think about sustainability.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
I use three public datasets from Our World in Data (FAO-based). The first contains aquaculture production by entity and year; the second includes both aquaculture and capture fisheries so I can directly compare and identify the crossover where aquaculture surpasses capture; the third reports shares of fish stocks that are biologically sustainable vs overexploited, grounding the sustainability angle.

I plan to use these datasets together to tell a connected story. The aquaculture and capture production data will show the historical rise of farmed fish and highlight the turning point where aquaculture surpassed capture. Breaking the data down by country and region will allow me to identify leading producers and regional differences in reliance on aquaculture. The sustainability dataset adds important context, linking the stagnation of capture fisheries to overexploitation of wild stocks. Together, these sources allow me to illustrate not only the growth of aquaculture but also why it matters for the future of global food security.

| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Aquaculture production (metric tons) | [Link](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/aquaculture-farmed-fish-production) | Annual aquaculture output by country/region. |
| Capture fisheries vs aquaculture | [Link](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/capture-fisheries-vs-aquaculture) | Annual production for both capture and aquaculture by entity. |
| Fish stocks: sustainable vs overexploited | [Link](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fish-stocks-within-sustainable-levels) | Share of fish stocks within sustainable levels vs overexploited (regional series). |


# Method and medium
I will use Tableau to create interactive charts and then embed them in Shorthand to build a scroll-based narrative. This combination allows me to present both the data analysis and the story flow in an engaging, interactive way.
